# Feynman---Kac-Matlab-Example
Probabilistic solutions to PDEs - simple examples with MATLAB
The snippet laplace.m solves the Dirichelet problem for the Laplacian on the square [0,1] X [0,1] with a simple boundary condition using the result of Feynman-Kac theorem.
The same problem is solved using a Markov chain 2D random walk transition matrix in FeynmanrandwalkMarkov2D.m This solution emerges from the same probabilistic principle but path random generation is avoided, the randomness being encoded in the transition matrix.
